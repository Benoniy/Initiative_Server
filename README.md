# Initiative_Server  

This will eventually be an independent server for a piece for software capable of hosting online  
dnd games. It based on the backend of a simple commandline messaging program I made and so its  
quite messy at the moment but its most basic functionality is solid. I hope to expand it into a  
fully usable application in the coming months.
